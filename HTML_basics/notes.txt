Html just gives us text in a proper formatted style

It understands basic elements like 
paragraph <p> </p>

Headings  <h1> </h1>

Image 


we need tags to place these elements. It works like
containers to contain values

Tags are of opening and closing type.
Combination of the tags and the content
between them is called an element.

Tags can be nested as well.




Boilerplater: The part that will always
remain

Everything is wrapped between
<html> </html>


Include all the meta data (extra info) in the
<head> </head> tag. These never gets displayed


<title> goes in the head tag and it needs
to be named carefully at it becomes the
name of the tab


All the content in the body tag will
appear in the webpage


Attributes are used to add more info to a tag



Anchor element is used to attach links 
we can use links on internet or use relative links which are pages present locally
<a href="www. .... " > Click here </a>
<img src ="image.png" alt= "A photo was here" height="300px"  width="300px"> This tag does not have pairs like <br>
src can use online links or locally stored images
copy image address from online
